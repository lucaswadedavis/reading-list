# [Freedom of Speech Is Now Largely an Illusion](http://blog.dilbert.com/post/157201503761/freedom-of-speech-is-now-largely-an-illusion)

Here's a fresh example (today) of how Twitter throttles back my free speech when it doesn't fit their political views. This only happens for Trump-related content, as far as I can tell. I haven't seen an exception yet. Notice the referenced tweet shows as "unavailable" but it actually is available when users click the link. Twitter does this trick so my followers will think the link is gone and they won't bother to click. This Twitter censorship method is well-documented by others. ![](http://68.media.tumblr.com/d4f86eced0bf436902515f15c8addfa8/tumblr_inline_olbtqprEVD1t63ajm_500.png)

The clever thing about Twitter's approach is that they randomize it so everyone sees my content sometimes, but no one sees the good stuff all of the time. That creates the illusion that it might be a fluke, a temporary bug, or just a perceptual thing. Best of all, it makes people like me look like conspiracy nuts. This is brilliant technique for mind control. It took me about a year to see this as a real thing. I thought everyone that was yapping about it was in deep conspiracy theory mode too. Most of you reading this post will think the same about me.

And you might be right, which is even cooler. As you know, the only person who can't see the cognitive dissonance is the one in it. So I can never rule out the possibility that the problem is on my end.

I won't ask you to believe me about Twitter's backdoor assault on the First Amendment. That would be a waste of energy. Just file it away in your brain and remember that I warned you. Twitter's business is about to fall apart and I expect that you'll see this story emerge from whistleblowers.

I'm trying to get my channel on YouTube running smoothly for after Twitter's collapse. I'm still having massive and unpredictable hardware/software issues. You'll see my A/B testing over at
